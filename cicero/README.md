# CICERO: A Domain-Specific Architecture for Efficient Regular Expression Matching
 
Cicero is a domain specific architecture that can be employed to perform exact regular expression (RE) matching using FPGAs.
The cool fact about Cicero is that - as other software libraries one among the other RE2 - does not suffer from backtracking problem.
This means that when it elaborate a REs that carry some kind of non-determinsm (e.,g. a?a ) it does not take a guess and then backtrack but can explore all the different options in a single pass of the input string.

If you are interested in the topic take a look at [Russ Cox article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html)

Here it follows an high level overview of Cicero Engines and how they can be combined together.

Cicero has its own [compiler](https://github.com/ironmanna/xohw23-Hardware-and-Software-Optimization-for-regular-expression/cicero_compiler) that converts REs in our custom ISA.
